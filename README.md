# word_counter_py
The Python script in main.py performs basic file reading and list manipulation operations. It begins by opening a text file named simple.txt and reads its contents line by line. Each line is split into a list of words (based on spaces), and these lists are appended to a master list c. This results in a two-dimensional list where each sublist contains words from a single line of the file. The script then initializes a variable d to zero and iterates over the indices of the list c, adding each index to d. Finally, it prints the list c and the accumulated sum d, which effectively equals the sum of integers from 0 to len(c) - 1.
